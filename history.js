/*
! Introduction
The old manual data entry had some problems so introduced databases 

! Nonrelational Database Systems
early days databases are hyrancyal tress with parents ,nodes, and childrens

! The Relational Model
1970's 
proposal was to keep tables to store data in a row for datasets and columns for data types 
primary key --> defines a row uniqly 
compund key --> if multiples colums are used to define a row 
foreign key --> key to relate one table to another 

No data redundancy 
Normalisation techniques --> to keep data integrety well

! SQL
language to work with relational db's 
DSL/Alpha --> Square --> Sql 
The result of an SQL query is a table
so we can  create  a record with just the result
